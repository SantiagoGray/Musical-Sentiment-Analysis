# Musical-Sentiment-Analysis
# **Introduction**
### Overview
#### Music has the unique ability to evoke a wide range of emotions, from joy and excitement to calm and relaxation. Different genres are often associated with distinct emotional experiences, influenced by elements such as rhythm, tempo, and melody. This project explores how various musical genres affect listeners' emotions and aims to uncover patterns across genres by analyzing the emotional impact of their audio features.
### Objective
#### The primary objective of this project is to investigate the emotional responses triggered by different music genres through the analysis of key audio features. By examining factors such as tempo, valence (emotional positivity), sentiment, and energy levels in top songs across several genres, I hope to determine if there are consistent patterns in how these features influence emotional perception.
### Research Question
#### How do different musical genres influence listeners' emotions, and can this influence be determined by analyzing audio features such as tempo, valence, and sentiment?




# Conclusion
### Research Question: How do different musical genres influence listeners' emotions, and can this influence be determined by analyzing audio features such as tempo, valence, and sentiment?

The aim of this analysis was to identify the defining characteristics that evoke the emotional responses associated with different musical genres. For instance, **Pop** is often linked to feelings of joy, energy, and excitement. **Album Rock** tends to evoke a thoughtful, adventurous, and wide range of emotions. **Neo Mellow** is associated with calmness and soothing effects. **Adult Standards** evoke nostalgia, romance, and tranquility. Lastly, **British Soul** carries deep, passionate emotions.

###  Findings
This analysis highlights key audio features that contribute to the emotional qualities of each genre. While there are many other attributes to consider, these features stand out as defining characteristics.
#### Album Rock
- **High Energy:** Album rock's high energy often gives it a nostalgic, uplifting feel.
- **High Speechiness:** The storytelling aspect of album rock is enhanced by high speechiness, helping convey narrative depth.
- **High Liveness:** The high liveness suggests that these tracks shine in live performances, a signature of album rock concerts. Imagine experiencing "Winds of Change" live!
- **Low Acousticness:** The use of electric guitars lowers acousticness, complementing its energetic and lively sound.
#### Adult Standards
- **Low Energy:** The low energy of adult standards lends itself to calmer, more romantic tracks that are best enjoyed at a softer volume.
- **Low Loudness:** Low loudness contributes to the genre’s nostalgic and soothing nature.
- **Low Duration:** While songs tend to be shorter, no strong correlation between duration and specific emotions was identified.
#### Pop
- **High Energy:** Pop’s high energy creates a joyful, danceable atmosphere that makes you want to move.
- **High Danceability:** Combined with high energy, its danceability is a key reason why pop is popular in clubs.
- **High Loudness:** Louder volumes enhance the energetic and uplifting feeling typical of pop music.
- **High Speechiness:** The fast-paced, word-heavy nature of pop contributes to its high energy, distinguishing it from calmer genres.
#### British Soul
- **High Volume:** The genre’s high volume amplifies the passion behind its lyrics. Adele, for example, uses volume shifts to heighten emotional impact.
- **Low Valence (Low Positivity / High Negativity):** British soul often conveys heartbreak and love, which explains its low valence. The blend of sad themes and powerful delivery results in a deeply emotional genre.
#### Neo Mellow
- **High Acousticness:** The genre’s use of acoustic instruments like guitars gives it a mellow, soothing sound that aligns with its calmer tone.
- **Low Energy:** Neo mellow is known for its subdued energy, evoking emotional depth and introspection.
- **Low Valence:** Its lower valence reflects the sad or melancholic themes often found in the lyrics.
- **Low Liveness:** Though the genre may not translate as well to live settings compared to pop or album rock, its acoustic nature and emotional weight resonate in intimate listening experiences.

#### Takeaways:
- This analysis provides insight into how different audio features contribute to the emotional responses elicited by various musical genres. Each genre's distinct combination of energy, loudness, and instrumental choices creates a unique emotional landscape, showing that music’s emotional influence can, to some extent, be analyzed and understood through its audio attributes.

### Other Findings:
#### Through this analysis I was also able to find qualities that will help a song reach the top charts. These qualities include:
- High levels of Liveness, valance, duration, and energy.
- Low levels of accousticness.
